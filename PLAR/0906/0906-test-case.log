You are an expert at playing RTS games and you aim to make a plan to beat the opponent based on all information provided in the following.

## Game Rules
MicroRTS is a classical Real-Time Strategy game, and the following is the manual, including rules and other useful information to master the game. 


## Opponent Information
From the past matches with the opponent, we have summarized the opponent's strategy and tactics as follows. 


## Task Description
Given the following description of the battlefield situation, your task is to make a deliberate plan to win the fight, specifically, you need to formulate strategies in the form of a Course of Action (COA). Your COA should be in the space of {[Harvest Mineral], [Build Base], [Build Barrack], [Produce Worker], [Produce Light Soldier], [Produce Heavy Soldier], [Produce Ranged Soldier], [Attack Enemy Worker], [Attack Enemy Buildings], [Attack Enemy Soldiers]}.

There are some examples.
The Situation: There are 2 mineral fields in this map. The mineral field located in (0, 0) has 4 available resources. The mineral field located in (3, 3) has 4 available resources. The red team has one base located in (2, 1) with 0 remaining resource, 4 remaining HP, and the current action of it is noop. The red team has no barrack. The red team has one worker located in (2, 2), which carries 0 resource and the current action is noop. The red team has no light soldier. The red team has no heavy soldier. The red team has no ranged soldier. The blue team has one base located in (1, 2) with 0 remaining resource, 4 remaining HP, and the current action of it is noop. The blue team has no barrack. The blue team has one worker located in (1, 1), which carries 0 resource and the current action is noop. The blue team has no light soldier. The blue team has no heavy soldier. The blue team has no ranged soldier.

The Situation: There is one mineral field located in (0, 0) with 4 available resources. The red team has one base located in (3, 3) with 0 remaining resource, 4 remaining HP, and the current action of it is noop. The red team has no barrack. The red team has no worker.

The blue team has one base located in (1, 1) with 0 remaining resource, 4 remaining HP, and the current action of it is noop. The blue team has no barrack. The blue team has one worker located in (0, 1), which carries 0 resource and the current action is noop. The blue team has no light soldier. The blue team has no heavy soldier. The blue team has no ranged soldier.

1. [Harvest Mineral]
2. [Build Barrack]
3. [Produce Worker]
4. [Produce Light Soldier]
5. [Attack Enemy Worker]
6. [Attack Enemy Buildings]
END of COA

Explanation:
1. Harvest Mineral: Since there is only one mineral field and it is not under immediate threat, the first step is to harvest minerals to build up resources.
2. Build Barrack: A barrack is necessary to produce soldiers. Building a barrack should be the next step to prepare for combat.
3. Produce Worker: Workers are essential for resource gathering and building structures. Producing a worker will help to gather more resources and build more structures.
4. Produce Light Soldier: Light soldiers are fast and can quickly attack enemy workers and buildings. Producing a light soldier will help to weaken the enemy's economy and infrastructure.
5. Attack Enemy Worker: Attacking the enemy worker will disrupt the enemy's resource gathering and weaken their economy.
6. Attack Enemy Buildings: Once the enemy's economy is weakened, attacking their buildings will help to further weaken their infrastructure and prevent them from producing more soldiers.
